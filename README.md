# TriEZy
### A HackMIT 2019 Project
A web app to facilitate and organize Mass Casualty Incident responses, making triage and resource allocation easy and efficient!

## What does it do?
TriEZy can be used by several members of the emergency response team. An Incident Commander can add new MCIs, which notifies the Dispatch team to send First Responders, such as EMTs, to the incident site. First Responders can check their location with regards to the area of incidence and await further instructions from the Triage Officer, who is in charge of ensuring that all patients are found and the severity of their conditions cataloged. Using this app, the Triage Officer can quickly and systematically triage injured patients, who can then be assigned by the Incident Commander to First Responders to assist as they arrive on scene. The web app also comes with GPS and automobile data for safety procedures such as a required fuel level for inclement weather.
